## ⚠️ Notice

This repository contains an **older version** of our airway segmentation model and is now **deprecated**.

For the latest version with improved performance, better generalization, and a learnable attention mechanism, please refer to our new repository:

👉 **[AirSeg: Learnable Interconnected Attention Framework for Robust Airway Segmentation](https://github.com/chetana348/AirSeg-Learnable-Interconnected-Attention-Framework-for-Robust-Airway-Segmentation)**

---

## ✅ Why Keep This Repo?

While deprecated, this model:
- Remains fully functional
- Can serve as a **lightweight baseline**
- Offers a great **starting point** for airway segmentation tasks or model prototyping

> 💡 Ideal for researchers who want to understand the foundations of the newer AirSeg architecture or build simpler extensions.
